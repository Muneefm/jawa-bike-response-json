To quickly bring you up to speed, Jawa ‘launched’ three bikes last month, but the more powerful, bobber-style Perak won’t be ready for sale till about August 2019. The Jawa and the Jawa Forty Two, meanwhile, will reach showrooms shortly and these are the bikes you’ll be reading about here. The Jawa is a fervently faithful recreation of the original Type 353 model, and it’s instantly recognisable, right to the point that villagers on the highway in Rajasthan came up and asked when Jawa had returned. That kind of recognition of a product from people who probably have no connectivity to the internet and no real interest in new motorcycles is something I’ve never seen before.",

The mill is so tuned as to produce a healthy 27bhp of power and 28Nm of torque. Both the bikes have been designed to recreate the iconic ‘Jawa exhaust music’. Thus, these are evidently the true modern classics of the day.",

As Classic Legends says, the company responsible for this exercise, Jawa is back. We’ve seen images, we know the names they have chosen for the range - Jawa and the FortyTwo, with the Perak to follow later,  we’ve even had the important numbers announced. In case you had missed that, the Forty Two will retail at Rs 1.55 lakh, while the Jawa will be Rs 1.64 lakh (ex-showroom). On with the rest of the details then.",
