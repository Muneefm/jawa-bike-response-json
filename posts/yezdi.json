So many people own these old bikes and it’s interesting to discuss how we got them in our families or came about owning one. There are people who have learned how to ride a motorcycle on a Jawa and are still riding the very same bike. It’s a great place for all these like-minded people together.”.\n",

We’re the second generation owners. I’m very excited to see the new Jawa,” he said.\nThengodkar added that since these motorcycles weren’t in production for a very long time, their numbers have dwindled. \n“It’s a very small community that exists. Getting around 250 people and making them ride so far is a big event in itself. These machines are all more than 30 to 40 years old,” he said.\nHe said the new bikes will be available for display and test drives at the event. “Since the deliveries are only starting from March, we expect new owners to attend the next event,” he said.\n“There is renewed interest in these bikes as the new Jawa bike was launched just recently,” Acharya said.\nThe very first Jawa showrooms in the country were opened in the city on December 15.\n",
