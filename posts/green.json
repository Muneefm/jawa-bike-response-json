            "text": "The Jawa Forty Two is the entry-level motorcycle and is less of a classic roadster than its Jawa sibling. Priced at Rs. 1.55 lakh (ex-showroom), Jawa responded to customers’ expectations and introduced the rear disc with dual-channel ABS system for additional price of around Rs. 9,000 recently. \nThe Forty Two can be had in several different colour choices such as Halley’s Teal, Galactic Green, Starlight Blue, Lumos Lime, Nebula Blue and Comet Red. The matte Galactic Green colour, in particular, is highly attractive on the Forty Two, and Jawa compared it to being omnipresent as nature and the feeling of zen that engulfs you the moment when eyes are feasted on it.\nThe Forty Two has aggressive rider’s triangle when compared to the regular Jawa classic as the handlebar is positioned more upright. The motorcycle is tuned to deliver committed riding targetting youngsters seeking a daily commute and it derives power from a 293 cc, four-stroke, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled DOHC engine.\nIt is good enough to develop a maximum power output of 27 bhp and 28 Nm of peak torque and is connected to a six-speed constant mesh gearbox. The Jawa Forty Two tips the weighing scale at around 170 kilograms and it features seat height of 765 mm with fuel tank capacity capable of holding 14 litres. The motorcycle runs on 90/90-18 front and 120/80-17 rear tyres.\n",
